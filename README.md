Introduction to Stereo Vision (IN WORK)

This repository will contain notebooks to provide a hands on approach to leanring stereo vision. The goal for each notebook is to teach a concept and to make some sort of artifact that demostrates either the concept itself or the application of the concept.

The first notebook of the tutorial only proivdes a high level overview of stereo vision, but it will provide insight into how it can be applied and will help motivate some of the more detailed concepts.
